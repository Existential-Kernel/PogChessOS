## Types of contributions
This is one of my first "big" projects I've done so far. If there's anything that's wrong about my code such as (but not limited to):
* Syntax errors
* Typos
* Code errors
* Inefficient code
* Useless code
* Refactorable code
* etc...

## Contribution guidelines

Please create an [issue](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/issues) or a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/pulls) to fix anything you've spotted that can be classified in the aforementioned criterias. Any criticism is also accepted. 

Any kind of contribution is welcome no matter how small. If you have an idea that I haven't thought of, or want to add a feature listed in the "TODO" section, please create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/pulls) on the contribution you would like to add. If you don't know how to use git, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/issues) for the suggestion/contribution you'd like to make.

If you're a code contributor, you can also add your username in the [credits](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/blob/main/README.md#credits) section of the [README](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/blob/main/README.md) if you want.
