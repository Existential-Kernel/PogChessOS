# CONTRIBUTING
This is one of my first "big" projects I've done so far. If there's anything that's wrong about my code such as (but not limited to):
* Syntax errors
* Typos
* Code errors
* Inefficient code
* Useless code
* Refactorable code
* etc...

Please create an [issue](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/issues) or a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/pulls) to fix anything you've spotted that can be classified in the aforementioned criterias. Any kind of criticism applies to this section too. 

Code contributions are also welcomed. If you have an idea that I haven't thought of, or want to add a feature listed in the "TODO" section, please create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/pulls) on the contribution you would like to add. If you don't know how to use git, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/issues) for the suggestion/contribution you'd like to make.
