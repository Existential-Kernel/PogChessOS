## Docs 
Please read the [documentation](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/blob/main/docs/Documentation.md) to read about the process of the project, the intentions I had, the algorithm used for the engine, etc... This documentation was specifically designed for my highschool programming project for my CS class, so it's not the traditional kind of documentation you'd expect on github.

## Notes
This is one of my first "big" projects I've done so far. If there's anything that's wrong about my code such as (but not limited to):
* Syntax errors
* Typos
* Code errors
* Inefficient code
* Useless code
* Refactorable code
* etc...

Please create an [issue](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/issues) or a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/pulls) to fix anything you've spotted that can be classified in the aforementioned criterias. Any kind of criticism applies to this section too. 

Code contributions are also welcomed. If you have an idea that I haven't thought of, or want to add a feature listed in the "TODO" section, please create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/pulls) on the contribution you would like to add. If you don't know how to use git, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/Existential-nonce/PogChess/issues) for the suggestion/contribution you'd like to make.
